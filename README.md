<h1 align="center">Hi ðŸ‘‹, Iâ€™m Chiira (Shira)</h1>

I help build thoughtful and impactful developer tools and web applicationsâ€”from payment flows to AI agents. Passionate about clean architecture, rapid learning, and creating systems that just work. Currently documenting my journey hereâ€”every weekend or day, building consistently and meaningfully.

###  Goal?
- **Pushing consistently**: Aiming for a 300+ day commit streak before graduation ðŸ—“
- **Documenting in public**: Sharing lessons from frontend, AI agents, and automation.
- **Open for collab**: If youâ€™re working on React, Node.js, or AI prototypesâ€”letâ€™s connect and build.

This README is a snapshotâ€”a mini-portfolio of where I am today. When I revisit it years from now, Iâ€™ll want to see progress, momentum, and where consistency took me.
