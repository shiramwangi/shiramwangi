###  About Me
I help build thoughtful and impactful developer tools and web applications—from payment flows to AI agents. Passionate about clean architecture, rapid learning, and creating systems that just work. Currently documenting my journey here—every weekend or day, building consistently and meaningfully.

###  Goal?
- **Pushing consistently**: Aiming for a 300+ day commit streak before graduation 🗓
- **Documenting in public**: Sharing lessons from frontend, AI agents, and automation.
- **Open for collab**: If you’re working on React, Node.js, or AI prototypes—let’s connect and build.

###  For Future Me (and you):
This README is a snapshot—a mini-portfolio of where I am today. When I revisit it years from now, I’ll want to see progress, momentum, and where consistency took me.
